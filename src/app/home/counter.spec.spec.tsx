For your request, let’s presume the content that needs testing is a simple service in a NestJS application called `MathService` with methods for adding and subtracting numbers as well as a React component named `MessageDisplay` that displays a message based on prop values. Following the guidelines provided, I will craft unit test files for both the service and the component. 

## MathService (NestJS)
Let’s start with the `MathService`. It has two methods: `add(a, b)` and `subtract(a, b)`.

### MathService.spec.ts
typescript
import { MathService } from './MathService';

describe('MathService', () => {
  let mathService: MathService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mathService = new MathService();
  });

  describe('add', () => {
    it('should return the sum of two numbers', () => {
      expect(mathService.add(1, 2)).toBe(3);
    });
  });

  describe('subtract', () => {
    it('should return the difference when the first number is larger', () => {
      expect(mathService.subtract(5, 3)).toBe(2);
    });

    it('should return the difference when the second number is larger (resulting in a negative number)', () => {
      expect(mathService.subtract(3, 5)).toBe(-2);
    });
  });
});

This unit test file focuses on testing each method in isolation and breaks the tests down based on behavior, maintaining clear and understandable descriptions.

## MessageDisplay (React)
Now, let’s address the `MessageDisplay` component which might display a message based on props.

### MessageDisplay.test.jsx
jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import MessageDisplay from './MessageDisplay';

describe('MessageDisplay', () => {

  it('should render the message provided via props', () => {
    render(<MessageDisplay message="Test message" />);
    const messageElement = screen.getByText(/test message/i);
    expect(messageElement).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('should not render any text when no message is provided', () => {
    const { container } = render(<MessageDisplay />);
    expect(container).toBeEmptyDOMElement();
  });
});

This test file ensures we're not only checking for the existence of elements but also their absence under certain conditions, following the outlined guidelines closely and providing straightforward, purposeful tests.

These examples demonstrate unit testing for both backend (NestJS service) and front-end (React component) elements under the stipulated guidelines, focusing on clarity, conciseness, and relevance to the functionality being tested.
