Given the component `SimpleList` provided, here's how a unit test file `SimpleList.test.js` could look like using Jest and React Testing Library principles. This unit test focuses on ensuring the `SimpleList` component renders properly and displays the correct number of items.

// SimpleList.test.js
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import SimpleList from './SimpleList';

describe('SimpleList Component', () => {
  let container = null;

  // Use beforeEach to setup a DOM element as the render target before each test
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Render returns an object with several properties, one of which is container
    // In this case, we're destructuring container directly from the render method's return value
    const { container: renderedContainer } = render(<SimpleList />);
    container = renderedContainer;
  });

  it('should be defined', () => {
    expect(SimpleList).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('renders a heading', () => {
    expect(screen.getByText('Simple List')).toBeDefined();
  });

  it('renders the correct number of list items', () => {
    // Use querySelectorAll to count the number of <li> elements within the container
    const listItemElements = container.querySelectorAll('li');
    expect(listItemElements.length).toBe(6); // As we know there are 6 items predefined in the SimpleList component
  });

  it('renders all predefined items correctly', () => {
    // Predefined items in the component
    const items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Grapes", "Peach", "Watermelon"];
    
    // Check each item for its presence
    items.forEach(item => {
      expect(screen.getByText(item)).toBeDefined();
    });
  });
});


This test suite for the `SimpleList` component adheres to the provided guidelines and principles:

- It correctly imports and tests the `SimpleList` component.
- It uses `describe` and `it` blocks to structure tests clearly and meaningfully.
- It favors `toBeDefined()` when checking the presence of elements, in compliance with the directive not to use `toBeInTheDocument()`.
- It avoids duplication by using `beforeEach` for common setup tasks.
- It employs readable and meaningful names for variables and functions, ensuring clarity and understandability.
- It splits tests to respect the SINGLE responsibility principle, with each test dedicated to one assertion or aspect of the component.
