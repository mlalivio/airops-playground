This ensures that a fresh instance of the component is available for each test.4. **Rendering Test**: The first test checks if the component renders without crashing. This basic sanity check ensures that the component is defined.5. **Title Test**: Confirms that the `SimpleList` title renders correctly. This specific test verifies static texts, which are crucial for user understanding and UX.6. **List Items Display Test**: Tests if each item from the predefined list in the component is displayed. Iterating through each item verifies the dynamism of list rendering.7. **Correct Number of Items Test**: Asserts that the exact number of list items rendered matches the expected count. This validation ensures that the component correctly handles the array data.This file structure adheres to the **SINGLE responsibility principle** by dedicating each test case to a specific aspect of the component. It makes use of `it` blocks for individual test cases, follows clean code principles for clarity and readability, and avoids unnecessary complexity, making it accessible to developers of various skill levels.
