To create a unit test for the `SimpleList` component based on the rules given, we will use Jest along with React Testing Library. The unit test will focus on ensuring the `SimpleList` component renders correctly, the list of items is displayed as expected, and that there are no duplicates in the list items rendered. 

First, ensure that `jest` and `@testing-library/react` are installed in your project. If they are not installed, you can add them by running:

shell
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react


Now, let's write the unit test for the `SimpleList` component in a file named `SimpleList.test.js`.

jsx
// SimpleList.test.js

import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import SimpleList from './SimpleList';   // Properly import the component to be tested

describe('SimpleList Component', () => {
  let listElements;

  // Use beforeEach to render the component before each test to avoid duplicate code
  beforeEach(() => {
    render(<SimpleList />);
    listElements = screen.getAllByRole('listitem');
  });

  it('should be defined', () => {
    expect(SimpleList).toBeDefined(); // Check if the component is defined
  });

  it('renders the list of items correctly', () => {
    const items = ["Apple", "Banana", "Orange", "Grapes", "Peach", "Watermelon", "Fruit"];
    // Ensure all items are rendered, duplicates in the data should result in unique test case handling
    items.forEach(item => {
      const matchingElements = listElements.filter((elem) => elem.textContent === item);
      expect(matchingElements.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1);
    });
  });

  it('renders a specified number of items', () => {
    // Since there are duplicate 'Fruit' entries, the total should reflect the array length 
    expect(listElements).toHaveLength(8);
  });

  it('does not render unexpected items', () => {
    // Demonstrate checking against items not in the list, ensuring only expected items are rendered
    const unexpectedItems = ['Pineapple', 'Mango'];
    unexpectedItems.forEach(item => {
      expect(screen.queryByText(item)).not.toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});


This unit test file makes sure to:
- Import the `SimpleList` component correctly.
- Use `describe` and `it` blocks to organize tests and provide clear descriptions.
- Implement `beforeEach` to render the component before each test, reducing redundant code.
- Check if the `SimpleList` component is defined, ensuring it exists before further testing.
- Test if the component renders the correct number of list items, including handling duplicates properly.
- Verify that all expected items are rendered and no unexpected items are present.

Additionally, this approach adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle by separating tests based on their unique responsibilities and ensures clarity and readability through descriptive test cases and careful use of React Testing Library functions.
